    <h3>What's Cooking</h3>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, tomatillos are not green tomatoes, but they could be considered a distant cousin. Also known as Mexican husk tomatoes, these green gems have an incredible tart flavor that mellows out when cooked.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Taco Seasoning</li>
        <li>10oz Ground Turkey</li>
        <li>1 med Red Onion</li>
        <li>6 Flour Tortillas</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>Green Tomatillo Salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F with a rack in the upper third. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add all but 2 tablespoons of the onions; cook, stirring, until softened and golden brown, 3–4 minutes. Add beef, 2¼ teaspoons taco seasoning, and a pinch of salt. Cook turkey, breaking up large pieces with a spoon, until browned, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place tortillas on a work surface; spoon about 3 tablespoons beef filling onto one half of each tortilla, and spread to a 4x1-inch rectangle. Top with cheese, then roll tightly, starting at the filled side of the tortilla. Place taquitos seam sides down on prepared baking sheet. Rinse and dry skillet and reserve for step 5.</li>
        <li>Generously brush tops and sides of taquitos with oil. Bake on upper oven rack until golden brown and crisp, 15–20 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve taquitos topped with tomatillo salsa and remaining chopped onions. Enjoy!</li>
